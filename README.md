# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Rubik's Cube Program

Cube program takes user input of the integers 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 in a grid fashion to be placed in 2D arrays 
6 cube sides so 6 2D arrays that will have 3 by 3 grids of the different numbers (each integer corresponds to a color)
Cube will check if the colors are in a possible format after user gives input 

Still needs to be done:
program will then swap integers with eachother depending on what rotations and turns need to be made using different methods
will then print instructions to solve the cube depeninng on what moves were made and using a switch statement.
